I did—especially during a heatwave when I realized I’d left the AC on full blast while away. Enter the ESP32, a $5 microcontroller that (with some tinkering) can emulate your AC’s IR remote and integrate it into Home Assistant. Here’s how I did it.

That’s where monitoring comes in.
In this guide, I’ll walk you through setting up a robust observability stack for Home Assistant using Prometheus (for scraping metrics), VictoriaMetrics (for fast, efficient storage), and Grafana (for beautiful dashboards).</description></item><item><title>High-Cardinality Metrics: Detection and Optimization in Prometheus and VictoriaMetrics</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/high-cardinality-optimization-victoriametrics-prometheus/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 21:48:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/high-cardinality-optimization-victoriametrics-prometheus/</guid><description>High-Cardinality Metrics: Detection and Optimization in Prometheus and VM I remember the first time my Prometheus instance crashed spectacularly after I added a new exporter.

A sudden spike might indicate a traffic surge or even a DDoS attack, while a sudden drop could signal a backend failure. Static thresholds work, but they often miss subtle patterns or raise too many false alarms. A better way is to use statistical anomaly detection—specifically Z-score based alerts in Prometheus.
In this post, we’ll walk through how to set up a Z-score PromQL alert to detect anomalies in HTTP request rates using only Prometheus and native PromQL.</description></item><item><title>A Full Guide to Monitoring Strategies for Enterprises</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/monitoring-strategy-enterprise/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2023 20:59:01 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/monitoring-strategy-enterprise/</guid><description>Monitoring, stop being blind!
After 3 years working in the monitoring team at the one of the biggest videogames company, I will unveil some secrets and strategies of monitoring for enterprises. These strategies can be applied to small or big companies depending on their context and uses.
But what is monitoring? Monitoring is the fact of collecting information about an entity (application, machine, URL&amp;hellip;) on a frequent basis. In general, this raw data is passed through visualization apps to give a visibility on the enterprise entities.</description></item><item><title>Vmalert: Revamp your Prometheus alert with microservices</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/vmalert-setup/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2023 08:14:23 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/vmalert-setup/</guid><description>Vmalert: the prometheus alerting microservice
While collecting metrics is important for monitoring, the real end goal is not visualizing the data. The most critical goal of metrics is to create alerts in case of bad behaviors or incidents. In the Prometheus world, prometheus itself generates alerts based on the metrics collected.
Let&amp;rsquo;s discover another product of VictoriaMetrics called Vmalert. To be honest, Vmalert is not a revolutionary product, exactly like Vmagent, but its strength is the ability to do 1 role: handling alerts with the minimum resources.</description></item><item><title>How to send duplicate RemoteWrite metrics</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/prometheus-duplicate-remotewrite/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 08:14:23 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/prometheus-duplicate-remotewrite/</guid><description>When working with metrics, you may want to send the metrics you&amp;rsquo;ve collected to 2 different prometheus instances for backup. Despite that a feature in Prometheus allows you send the metrics received to another prometheus, it&amp;rsquo;s not recommended to do that when working with high amounts of metrics.
Indeed, Prometheus consumes a lot of resources to do the remotewrite and this may reduce its capability to perform well. But other solution exists : lightweight, simple and works perfectly.</description></item><item><title>Esp32 + 1$ DHT22 temperature sensor</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/esp32-dht22-temperature-humidity-sensor/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Mar 2023 08:14:23 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/esp32-dht22-temperature-humidity-sensor/</guid><description>ESPHome is a powerful framework for building IoT devices using ESP8266, ESP32, and other microcontrollers.
