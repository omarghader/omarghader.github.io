Install jenkins Requirements for this tutorial : * Docker * Docker compose
We will user docker compose to configure jenkins docker container:
version: &#39;3.5&#39; services: jenkins: image: &#39;jenkins/jenkins:lts&#39; container_name: &#39;jenkins&#39; restart: always ports: - &#39;8080:8080&#39; - &#39;50000:50000&#39; volumes: - jenkins-data:/etc/gitlab - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock volumes: jenkins-data: name: jenkins-data Then, run the command :
$ docker-compose up -d Run Jenkins Once you had run the docker compose file, test that your jenkins is running by opening this url on your browser http://localhost:8080</description></item><item><title>Docker Compose Tutorial</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/docker-compose-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/docker-compose-tutorial/</guid><description>If you are tired of configuring your docker containers every time you want to run it, docker compose is the solution.

It became one of the best data analysis tools due to its performance and its syntax simplicity. R can import datasets or generate a csv file with 1 line of code.
So, It will be very important to use R with one of the most known programming languages : JAVA. Using JRI library, i will show you how to assign variables, run R scripts&amp;hellip;.</description></item><item><title>Docker Tutorial : PhpMyAdmin and MySQL Server</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/docker-tutorial-phpmyadmin-and-mysql-server/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/docker-tutorial-phpmyadmin-and-mysql-server/</guid><description>If you are new to Docker or you are wondering why docker is very popular today, I recommend you to read my previous posts Introduction to Docker.
Pull Containers from Docker registry Searching for containers Docker have a public registry where you could find images of dockerized application that are ready to use. All information and indications for using container are specified too.
In this post, I will show you how to connect PhpMyAdmin container to MySQL server container.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Docker</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/introduction-to-docker/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/introduction-to-docker/</guid><description>Docker is a new open-source project that makes deployment of applications easier. The idea of this technology is very simple : &amp;ldquo;the application runs inside a software container. This container is acting like a mini Operating System&amp;rdquo;. Basics are very similar to Virtual machine : An OS is running independently of host&amp;rsquo;s OS. Networking is working using bridges&amp;hellip; Docker is using 2 terms : image and container:
An image is a packaged application that is not running.</description></item><item><title>My First Post</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/my-first-post/</guid><description>Hi, This is my first post.
