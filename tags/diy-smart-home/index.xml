While voice commands and smartphone apps are convenient, there’s something deeply satisfying about physically turning a dial to dim the lights. I wanted to bridge that gap between the digital smarts of Home Assistant and the physical world. So, I set out to build a custom smart light dimmer with ESP32 and a rotary encoder.
The goal was simple: a knob that not only controls my smart lights locally but also stays perfectly in sync with their state in Home Assistant.</description></item><item><title>Turn ESP32 Into a BLE Beacon Scanner for Presence Detection in Home Assistant</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/esp32-ble-beacon-scanner-presence-detection-home-assistant/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/esp32-ble-beacon-scanner-presence-detection-home-assistant/</guid><description>Before we begin: This guide assumes you have Home Assistant already set up and are comfortable with basic ESPHome configurations. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried nearly every presence detection method in my smart home journey - from WiFi-based tracking that drained my phone battery to GPS solutions that were anything but reliable indoors. That&amp;rsquo;s when I discovered the magic of BLE beacon scanning with ESP32 for room-level presence detection. It&amp;rsquo;s been a game-changer for my home automations, and today I&amp;rsquo;ll show you exactly how to set it up.</description></item><item><title>DIY ESP32-Based Motion Sensor for Home Assistant Security Automations</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/esp32-pir-motion-sensor-home-assistant-automation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/esp32-pir-motion-sensor-home-assistant-automation/</guid><description>DIY ESP32-Based Motion Sensor for Home Assistant Security Automations Ever walked into a dark room and wished the lights would just know to turn on? Or wanted a simple way to alert you when someone’s lurking near your front door? That’s where a DIY ESP32-based PIR motion sensor comes in. I recently built one to integrate with Home Assistant, and it’s been a game-changer for my home security automations. Here’s how you can do it too—no PhD in electrical engineering required.</description></item></channel></rss>
