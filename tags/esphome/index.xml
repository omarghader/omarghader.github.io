Commercial room occupancy sensors work fine, but they&amp;rsquo;re expensive and often limited in functionality. After one too many instances of my smart lights turning off while I was still reading in my favorite armchair, I decided to build my own room occupancy tracker using an ESP32 and ultrasonic sensors.
The beauty of this approach?</description></item><item><title>Build a Smart Light Dimmer with ESP32 and a Rotary Encoder in Home Assistant</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/esp32-rotary-encoder-smart-light-dimmer-home-assistant/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/esp32-rotary-encoder-smart-light-dimmer-home-assistant/</guid><description>I’ve always loved the tactile feel of a good knob. While voice commands and smartphone apps are convenient, there’s something deeply satisfying about physically turning a dial to dim the lights. I wanted to bridge that gap between the digital smarts of Home Assistant and the physical world. So, I set out to build a custom smart light dimmer with ESP32 and a rotary encoder.
The goal was simple: a knob that not only controls my smart lights locally but also stays perfectly in sync with their state in Home Assistant.</description></item><item><title>Turn ESP32 Into a BLE Beacon Scanner for Presence Detection in Home Assistant</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/esp32-ble-beacon-scanner-presence-detection-home-assistant/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/esp32-ble-beacon-scanner-presence-detection-home-assistant/</guid><description>Before we begin: This guide assumes you have Home Assistant already set up and are comfortable with basic ESPHome configurations. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried nearly every presence detection method in my smart home journey - from WiFi-based tracking that drained my phone battery to GPS solutions that were anything but reliable indoors. That&amp;rsquo;s when I discovered the magic of BLE beacon scanning with ESP32 for room-level presence detection. It&amp;rsquo;s been a game-changer for my home automations, and today I&amp;rsquo;ll show you exactly how to set it up.</description></item><item><title>Control a Smart Fan with ESP32 and Home Assistant Using Temperature Triggers</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/control-smart-fan-esp32-home-assistant-temperature-triggers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/control-smart-fan-esp32-home-assistant-temperature-triggers/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated with making my home smarter, especially when it comes to energy efficiency and comfort. There&amp;rsquo;s something deeply satisfying about having your home respond to environmental conditions without lifting a finger. In this tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how I built a system that automatically controls a fan based on room temperature using an ESP32 and Home Assistant.
Why I Built This System Living in a climate with hot summers, I found myself constantly adjusting fans throughout the day.</description></item><item><title>Automating Window Blinds with ESP32 Servo Motor and Home Assistant</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/automate-window-blinds-esp32-servo-home-assistant/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/automate-window-blinds-esp32-servo-home-assistant/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated with the idea of waking up to natural sunlight instead of a blaring alarm clock. But as someone who also values sleeping in on weekends, I needed a solution that could give me the best of both worlds. That&amp;rsquo;s when I decided to automate my window blinds with an ESP32 and servo motors, integrating everything seamlessly with Home Assistant.
After a few prototypes (and one slightly mangled blind slat), I&amp;rsquo;ve perfected a system that opens my blinds based on either time schedules or ambient light conditions.</description></item><item><title>DIY ESP32-Based Motion Sensor for Home Assistant Security Automations</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/esp32-pir-motion-sensor-home-assistant-automation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/esp32-pir-motion-sensor-home-assistant-automation/</guid><description>DIY ESP32-Based Motion Sensor for Home Assistant Security Automations Ever walked into a dark room and wished the lights would just know to turn on?
