While voice commands and smartphone apps are convenient, there’s something deeply satisfying about physically turning a dial to dim the lights. I wanted to bridge that gap between the digital smarts of Home Assistant and the physical world. So, I set out to build a custom smart light dimmer with ESP32 and a rotary encoder.
The goal was simple: a knob that not only controls my smart lights locally but also stays perfectly in sync with their state in Home Assistant.</description></item></channel></rss>
