I did—especially during a heatwave when I realized I’d left the AC on full blast while away. Enter the ESP32, a $5 microcontroller that (with some tinkering) can emulate your AC’s IR remote and integrate it into Home Assistant. Here’s how I did it.
What You’ll Need Hardware: ESP32 board (any variant with IR send/receive, like the ESP32-C3) IR receiver/sender module (e.</description></item><item><title>Monitoring Home Assistant with VictoriaMetrics and Grafana: A Step-by-Step Guide</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/monitoring-home-assistant-victoriametrics-grafana/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/monitoring-home-assistant-victoriametrics-grafana/</guid><description>Monitoring Home Assistant with VictoriaMetrics and Grafana If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably spent way too much time tweaking your Home Assistant setup—only to realize later that you have no idea whether your automations are running efficiently or if your Raspberry Pi is about to melt from CPU overload. That’s where monitoring comes in.
In this guide, I’ll walk you through setting up a robust observability stack for Home Assistant using Prometheus (for scraping metrics), VictoriaMetrics (for fast, efficient storage), and Grafana (for beautiful dashboards).</description></item><item><title>Automate Your Garden Watering with ESP32 and Home Assistant</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/automate-your-garden-watering-esp32-home-assitantant/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/automate-your-garden-watering-esp32-home-assitantant/</guid><description>Automate Your Garden Watering with ESP32 and Home Assistant Ever forgotten to water your plants only to find them looking like they’ve been on a desert trek? I have—more times than I’d like to admit. That’s why I built a smart garden watering system using an ESP32, soil moisture sensors, and Home Assistant. Now, my plants get watered automatically, and I get to pretend I’ve got a green thumb. Here’s how you can do it too.</description></item></channel></rss>
