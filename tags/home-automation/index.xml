That’s why I decided to take control by monitoring my home’s energy consumption in real-time using the Shelly Pro 2PM—a versatile, Wi-Fi-enabled energy monitoring device. In this guide, I’ll walk you through setting it up, integrating it with Home Assistant, and turning raw data into actionable insights.</description></item><item><title>DIY Smart Door Sensor with ESP32 and Home Assistant: A Step-by-Step Guide</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/diy-smart-door-sensor-esp32-home-assistant/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/diy-smart-door-sensor-esp32-home-assistant/</guid><description>DIY Smart Door Sensor with ESP32 and Home Assistant Ever walked out the door and wondered, Did I close it? I’ve been there too—until I built a DIY smart door sensor using an ESP32 and Home Assistant. Now, my phone buzzes if the door’s left ajar, and I’ve even set up automations to turn off the AC when the door’s open for too long (goodbye, wasted energy!). Here’s how you can build your own.</description></item><item><title>Control an IR Remote AC Using ESP32 and Home Assistant</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/control-ir-ac-esp32-home-assistant/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/control-ir-ac-esp32-home-assistant/</guid><description>Control an IR Remote AC Using ESP32 and Home Assistant Ever wished your dumb air conditioner could join your smart home party? I did—especially during a heatwave when I realized I’d left the AC on full blast while away. Enter the ESP32, a $5 microcontroller that (with some tinkering) can emulate your AC’s IR remote and integrate it into Home Assistant. Here’s how I did it.
What You’ll Need Hardware:
ESP32-DevKitC board: aliexpress
: Breadboard and jumper wires USB cable for power/flashing Software: Home Assistant (installed and running) ESPHome (via Home Assistant Add-on) Pro Tip: Test your IR LED before wiring—some have narrow angles.</description></item><item><title>Automate Your Garden Watering with ESP32 and Home Assistant</title><link>https://omarghader.github.io/automate-your-garden-watering-esp32-home-assitantant/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://omarghader.github.io/automate-your-garden-watering-esp32-home-assitantant/</guid><description>Automate Your Garden Watering with ESP32 and Home Assistant Ever forgotten to water your plants only to find them looking like they’ve been on a desert trek? I have—more times than I’d like to admit. That’s why I built a smart garden watering system using an ESP32, soil moisture sensors, and Home Assistant. Now, my plants get watered automatically, and I get to pretend I’ve got a green thumb. Here’s how you can do it too.</description></item></channel></rss>
